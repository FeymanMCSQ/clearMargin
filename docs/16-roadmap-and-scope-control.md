# ClearMargin — Roadmap & Scope Control

## Purpose
Prevent feature creep.

Every feature must justify itself against the core promise:
profit clarity.

---

## V1 MUST HAVE
- CSV upload
- deterministic calculations
- monthly report
- AI explanation
- basic billing

Nothing else.

---

## V1 WILL NOT BUILD
- dashboards
- live integrations
- forecasting
- multi-store views
- advanced analytics
- benchmarking

Requests matching these → rejected.

---

## V2 Candidate Ideas
(Not commitments)

- Shopify OAuth import
- automated monthly refresh
- PDF export
- simple trend comparison

---

## Feature Admission Criteria

A feature is allowed ONLY if:

1. Improves clarity directly
2. Does not increase cognitive load
3. Does not introduce financial ambiguity
4. Maintains deterministic calculation model

If ANY fail → reject.

---

## Scope Red Flags

Danger signs:
- "Just one more metric"
- "Users asked for dashboard"
- "AI could predict…"
- "Enterprise feature"

These indicate positioning drift.

---

## Principle

ClearMargin grows by depth, not breadth.
