# 1. Core SEO Philosophy

ClearMargin wins SEO by **clarity + specificity**.

We do NOT compete for:
- analytics software
- ecommerce tools
- accounting software

We compete for **one precise problem**:

👉 Understanding real Shopify profit.

Search engines reward pages that clearly solve a single intent.

Therefore:

One page = One problem = One intent.

---

# 2. Primary Search Intent

## Target User Thought
A seller realizes:
"I have revenue but I don't know my profit."

They open Google.

Our job:
be the cleanest answer.

---

## Primary Keywords (Tier 1)

These define the landing page intent.

- shopify profit calculator
- shopify profit report
- how to calculate shopify profit
- shopify revenue vs profit
- real shopify profit
- shopify margin calculator

Landing page MUST naturally align with these.

No keyword stuffing allowed.

---

## Secondary Keywords (Tier 2)

Future supporting content.

- shopify fees explained
- shopify profit tracking
- understand shopify margins
- ecommerce profit calculation
- shopify store profitability

---

## Keywords We Avoid

Avoid broad battles:

- ecommerce software
- business analytics
- accounting platform
- AI analytics

These attract wrong users.

---

# 3. Site Architecture for SEO

## V1 Structure

/
Landing page (primary ranking page)

No additional marketing pages required initially.

Minimalism improves authority concentration.

---

## Future Structure (V2)

Main landing page

/guides/
Educational pages solving specific searches

Example:
- /guides/how-to-calculate-shopify-profit
- /guides/shopify-fees-explained
- /guides/revenue-vs-profit-shopify

Each page targets ONE search intent.

---

# 4. On-Page SEO Rules

## H1 Rules
- Exactly ONE H1 per page.
- Must describe core problem.

Example:
Know If You're Actually Making Money.

---

## Heading Structure
H2 sections must reflect user questions.

Example:
H2: Revenue isn't profit
H2: How ClearMargin works
H2: Example monthly summary
H2: Who this is for
H2: Pricing

Headings help Google understand content hierarchy.

---

## Content Rules
Text must:
- be readable without jargon

- include natural keyword language

Forbidden:

- SEO bait paragraphs

---

# 5. Metadata Standards

Every page MUST include:

## Page Title
Format:
Primary keyword + Clear benefit

---

## Meta Description
120–160 characters.

Example:

---

## OpenGraph Tags

Avoid div-only layouts.

---

## Accessibility (Indirect SEO)

Accessible sites rank better.

---

# 8. Internal Linking Rules (Future)

When guides exist:

No link farms.

---

# 9. Content Expansion Strategy

ClearMargin does NOT run a blog.

We publish **problem-solving guides** only.

Each article must:
✔ solve one real search question
✔ remain timeless
✔ match product philosophy

Bad content example:
"Top 10 Ecommerce Trends 2026"

Good content example:
"How to Calculate Real Shopify Profit (Simple Explanation)"

---

# 10. Backlink Strategy (Reality-Based)

We do NOT buy backlinks.

Authority grows through:
- founder sharing insights
- indie hacker communities
- ecommerce forums
- real product usage

Trust compounds naturally.

---

# 11. Things That Break SEO (Forbidden)

Never:
- change URLs randomly
- rename pages without redirects
- add heavy JS frameworks unnecessarily
- auto-generate AI blogs
- create thin pages for keywords

SEO penalties come from noise, not absence.

---

# 12. Measurement (Minimal Analytics)

Track only:

- impressions
- clicks
- ranking keywords
- conversion from organic traffic

Avoid vanity metrics.

---

# 13. Long-Term Principle

ClearMargin wins SEO when Google learns:

"This page consistently explains Shopify profit clearly."

The product's clarity IS the SEO strategy.
