# ClearMargin — Brutally Minimal Landing Page Checklist (One-Time Use)

## Goal Test
A Shopify seller earning ~$1k–$20k/month can answer, within 10 seconds:
1) What is this?
2) What do I get?
3) Is it for me?
4) What does it cost?
5) What do I click?

If any answer requires scrolling twice or reading buzzwords, the page failed.

---

## Non-Negotiables
- White/off-white background
- One accent color only
- No “AI-powered”, no “dashboard”, no “integrations”
- No feature list sections
- No navigation links beyond logo + maybe “Pricing” anchor
- One primary CTA, repeated 2–3 times max
- Mobile-first readability

---

## Page Structure (in order)

### 1) HERO (above the fold)
**Must include:**
- H1: `Know If You’re Actually Making Money.`
- Subheadline (verbatim or near-verbatim):
  `ClearMargin turns your Shopify export into a simple, plain-English monthly profit summary — so you can see your real profit, your best product, and what’s quietly draining your margin.`
- Primary CTA button:
  `Get Early Access – $10/month`
- Microcopy under CTA:
  `No accounting knowledge required. No complex dashboards.`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] CTA visible without scroll on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Subheadline is max ~2 lines on desktop, ~3–4 on mobile
- [ ] No secondary CTA competing with primary
- [ ] No logos, no testimonials in v1 (optional later)

---

### 2) PROBLEM (emotional hook)
**Headline:**
`Revenue isn’t profit.`

**Paragraph (verbatim or tight):**
`Most small Shopify sellers look at revenue and hope for the best. But between payment fees, refunds, and ad spend, it’s hard to know what you’re actually making. Shopify analytics can feel overwhelming — and spreadsheets don’t always add up.`

`You shouldn’t need an accountant to understand your own business.`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No fear language (“bleeding money”, “disaster”, etc.)
- [ ] One short paragraph + one short closer sentence
- [ ] No charts/graphics here

---

### 3) HOW IT WORKS (3 steps)
**Must show exactly three steps:**
1) `Upload your Shopify export`
2) `We calculate your true net profit`
3) `Get a clear, easy-to-read monthly summary`

Then: `That’s it.`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Steps are a single row on desktop, stacked on mobile
- [ ] Icons are optional but minimal (simple line icons only)
- [ ] No mention of AI, integrations, dashboards
- [ ] No extra steps, no footnotes that add friction

---

### 4) SAMPLE REPORT (conversion section)
**Must display a mock report box** that visually resembles the actual product output.

Include exactly this content (or extremely close):

**Title:** `April Summary`

- `Revenue: $12,430`
- `Fees + Refunds: $1,840`
- `Ad Spend: $2,300`

- `✅ Real Profit: $8,290`

**Then:**
- `Top Product by Profit:`
  `"Minimalist Leather Wallet" – $2,140 profit`

- `Lowest Margin Product:`
  `"Canvas Tote Bag" – Only 9% margin due to ad costs`

- `📉 Warning: Instagram ads for Tote Bag cost more than they returned.`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Box is calm: light border, generous padding, no loud colors
- [ ] Numbers align cleanly (monospace or tabular figures)
- [ ] “Real Profit” is the most visually prominent element
- [ ] Warning feels informative, not alarmist

---

### 5) WHO IT’S FOR (filter)
**Bullets:**
- `Solo Shopify store owners`
- `$1k–$20k per month stores`
- `Sellers without accounting background`
- `Anyone tired of guessing their real profit`

**Exclusion line (must be present):**
`If you’re running a Shopify Plus brand or a marketing team, this probably isn’t for you.`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Bullet list is short (4 bullets)
- [ ] Exclusion line is plain, not snarky
- [ ] No persona overload, no “for everyone” language

---

### 6) PRICING (transparent)
**Must include:**
- `Early Access – $10/month`
- `Simple monthly summaries. No contracts. Cancel anytime.`
- CTA button повтор (same as hero):
  `Get Early Access – $10/month`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No tiers in v1
- [ ] No annual toggle
- [ ] No “starting at”
- [ ] Price is not hidden behind a click

---

### 7) FOOTER (bare minimum)
**Must include:**
- simple contact email
- tiny copyright line

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No big link clouds
- [ ] No social icons unless you’re actively posting
- [ ] No legal walls; link to privacy/terms only if required

---

## Design Rules (hard constraints)
- [ ] Background: white or off-white (#F8F9FB acceptable)
- [ ] One accent color for CTA + profit highlight
- [ ] Max 2 font weights for body
- [ ] No gradients, no animated charts, no metric tiles
- [ ] No multi-page navigation
- [ ] No “AI-powered” anywhere

---

## Copy Rules (hard constraints)
- [ ] No buzzwords: “revolutionary”, “advanced analytics”, “actionable insights”
- [ ] No speculation
- [ ] No feature laundry lists
- [ ] Every sentence either reduces confusion or increases trust

---

## Final Pre-Launch Checks (5-minute)
- [ ] Read the hero aloud: does it sound human?
- [ ] Can a user describe the product after 10 seconds?
- [ ] Does the sample report visually dominate the page?
- [ ] Is the CTA the obvious next step at all scroll positions?
- [ ] Mobile: no cramped sections, no tiny text, no horizontal scroll
